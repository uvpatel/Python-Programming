a = input("Enter a number: ") # enter a number is a prompt. use prompt to ask the user for input
print(a)

b = input("Enter Your Name: ")
print(b)

# input() function is used to take input from the user.it takes input as a string by default.

# prompt is optional paramenter. but it is a good practice to use prompt to ask the user for input.
