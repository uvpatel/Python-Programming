Rules for naming variables in Python:
1. Variable name should start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. Variable name can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
4. Variable name should not contain special characters like @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), etc.
5. Variable name should not be a reserved keyword in Python (e.g., if, else, for, while, etc.).
7. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., age and Age are different variables).
6. Variable name should be meaningful and descriptive.
3. Variable name should not start with a digit.

# a$$ge = 45 invalid variable name special characters only _ is allowed
